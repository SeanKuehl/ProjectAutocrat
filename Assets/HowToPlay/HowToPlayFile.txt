You are the absolute leader of a new nation. You must organize your society and lead them through 50 turns in order to make sure your nation succeeds.
You can organize your society by creating castes, groups of people of certain kinds with specific rights and occupations. 
You must have a police force and a military and you must keep them happy, if they're approval of you falls below -5 you will be overthrown!
Granting rights costs money, so be judicious with who you give rights to, as granting rights to too many will cost you.
Watch out for rebellion points, if you don't have enough police and military to keep the angry inferiors in line there will be a rebellion!
Castes also have 'relative approval', which means they gain or lose happiness based on their standing with other castes.
You can boost castes, the military or the police but do so only when you need to, otherwise you won't be able to use it in an emergency.
